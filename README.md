# FCC and ACS Pre-processing and EDA

The following document analyzes complaints filed to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from January 2021 to July 2022. This data set was pulled from the FCCâ€™s website. To better understand the demographics of the individuals who filed complaints, the FCC data set was merged with a subset of data from the American Community Survey (ACS) which comes from the United States Census Bureau. The attached analysis report summarizes the key findings and insights from the EDA. _Analyzing complaints about spam phone calls was an area of interest._
